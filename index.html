        Hi there! So you are just starting with Rails? That's great!
        And then this place is for you. It summarizes some of the most important
        information about Ruby on Rails. Those things that you tend to forget
        especially in the beginning like: <em>How do I start the server?</em>
        and <em>What was that config directory for again?</em>.
        Furthermore it is directly aimed at beginners so contrary to common
        concise cheat sheets it contains rather verbose descriptions of some
        concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        A word of warning: I just created this and it <strong>
        might contain faults and inaccuracies.</strong> Furthermore it is
        <strong>far from done!</strong> There still is a lot of information
        missing. But I will try to add it and so can you by contributing
        to my <a href="https://github.com/PragTob/rails-beginner-cheatsheet">
        repository</a>. If you <strong>notice any issues</strong> or have ideas
        to improve this cheat sheet please
        <a href="https://github.com/PragTob/rails-beginner-cheatsheet/issues">
        report it at github</a> or <a href="mailto:pragtob@gmail.com">drop me an
        email</a>.
      </p>

      <h1>Cheat Sheet Conventions</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Bold</strong> words are what is really important e.g.
        the command and concept shown in the usage category.
        In the examples and usage columns <em>Italic</em> words mark the
        arguments of a command/method. If they are in brackets, then they
        are optional arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
        However <em>italic words</em> in the descriptions or general text denote
        more general concepts or concepts explained elsewhere in this cheat
        sheet.
      </p>

      <h1>Console Basics</h1>
      <p>
        The console (also called <em>command line, command prompt or
        terminal</em>) is just another way of interacting with your computer.
        So you can basically do anything with it that you could also do with
        your graphical desktop user interface. This sections contains a couple
        of examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the different operating systems <strong>starting the console</strong>
        differs.

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Windows:</strong> Open the start menu and search for
          command prompt. Alternatively choose <em>execute</em> and enter
          <em>cmd</em></li>
          <li><strong>Mac:</strong> Open spotlight type <em>terminal</em> and
          start that program.</li>
          <li><strong>Linux:</strong> The terminal should be one of the main
          options once you open the main menu of your distribution. Otherwise
          search for <em>terminal</em> if your distribution has such an option
          or look under Accessories.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h1>Ruby Basics</h1>
      <p>
        Ruby is the programming language Ruby on Rails is written in. So most
        of the time you will be writing Ruby code. Therefore it is good to
        grasp the basics of Ruby. If you just want to play with ruby type
        <strong>irb</strong> into your console to start interactive ruby. There
        you can easily experiment with Ruby. To leave irb, type
        <strong>exit</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is just a very small selection of concepts. This is especially
        true later on when we talk about what Arrays, Strings etc. can do.
        For more complete information have a look at
        <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/">ruby-doc</a> or search with your favorite
        search engine!
      </p>

            </p>
          </td>
          <td>
            Ruby ignores everything that is marked as a comment. It does not try
            to execute it. Comments are just there for you, some information.
            Comments are also commonly used to <em>comment out code</em>. That
            is when you don't want some part of your code to execute anymore
            but you don't want to delete it just yet, because you are trying
            different things out.

         <td>
           With a variable you tell Ruby that from now on you want to refer to
           that value by the name you gave it. So for the first example, from
           now on when you use <em>name</em> Ruby will know that you meant
           <em>"Tobi"</em>.

            Prints its argument to the console. Can be used in Rails apps
            to print something in the console where the server is running.

            <p><code>string<strong>.gsub</strong><em>("ae", "ä")</em></code></p>
          </td>
          <td>
            <p>Calling a method is also often referred to as
            <em>sending a message</em> in Ruby. Basically we are sending an
            object some kind of message and are waiting for its response.
            So we kindly ask the object to do something or give us some
            information.
            When you call a method/send a message something happens. In the
            first example we ask a String how long it is e.g. how many
            characters it consists of. In the last example we substitute all
            occurrences of "ae" in the string with the german "ä".</p>
            <p>
              Different kinds of objects (Strings, Numbers, Arrays...)
              understand different messages.

          <td>
            <p>Methods are basically reusable units of behaviour. And you can
            define them yourself just like this. Methods are small and focused
            on implementing a specific behaviour.</p>
            <p>
              Our example method for instance is focused on greeting people,
              you could call it like this: <code>greet("Tobi")</code>

            <p><code>"Helo" <strong>==</strong> "Hello" # => false</code></p>
          </td>
          <td>
            With two equal signs you can check if 2 things are basically the
            same. If so, <code>true</code> will be returned otherwise the result
            will be <code>false</code>.

        <tr>
          <td>Inequality</td>

          </td>
          <td>
            Inequality is the inverse to equality, e.g. it results in
            <code>true</code> when two values are not the same and it results
            in <code>false</code> when they are the same.

          <td>
            <p>With if-clauses you can decide based upon a <em>condition</em>
            what to do. When the condition is considered true, then the code
            after if is executed. If it is considered false, the code after
            else is executed.</p>
            <p>
              In the example, access is granted based upon the decision if a
              given input matches the password.

<strong>ADULT_AGE</strong> # => 18</code></pre>
          </td>
          <td>
            Constants look like variables, just in UPCASE. Well both hold
            values and give you a name to refer to those values. However while
            the value a variable holds may change or might be of an unknown
            value (if you save user input in a variable) constants are
            different. They have a known value that should never change. Think
            of it a bit like mathematical or physical constants. These don't
            change, they always refer to the same value.

        just think of them as an ordered collection of characters.

      <h2>Arrays</h2>
      <p>
        An array is an ordered collection of things which is indexed by numbers.
        So an array contains multiple objects that are mostly related to each
        other. So what could you do? You could store a collection of the names
        of your favorite fruits and name it <em>fruits</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is just a small selection of things an Array can do, for more
        information have a look at the

      <h2>Hashes</h2>
      <p>
        Hashes are some kind of mapping, they map a given key to some value.
        You may then retrieve the value based upon its key. Keys ust be unique
        for a given hash, but you can have the same value for multiple keys.
        A bit like a dictionary you know. You have a key
        (the word you are looking up) and
        that leads you to a value (the entry for that word including a
        translation). That's also why this construct is called a
        <em>dictionaries</em> in other languages. But in Ruby we call them
        hashes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hashes can map from anything to anything! You can map from Strings to
        Numbers, Strings to Strings, Numbers to Booleans... and you can mix
        all of those! Although it is common that at least all the keys are of
        the same class. <em>Symbols</em> are especially common as keys. Symbols
        look like this: <code>:symbol</code>. So just a colon followed by some
        characters. You can think of them as special strings that stand for
        (symbolize) something!

            You create a hash by surrounding the key-value pairs with curly
            braces. The arrow always goes from the <em>key</em> to the
            <em>value</em> depicting the meaning: <em>"This key points to this
            value."</em>. Key-value pairs are then separated by commas.

            Accessing an entry in a hash looks a lot like accessing it in
            an <em>array</em>. However with a hash the key can be anything, not
            just numbers. If you try to access a key that does not exist the
            value <code>nil</code> is returned which is Ruby's way of saying
            "nothing", because if it doesn't know that key it also can't return
            a value for it!

            Assigning values again is pretty similiar to how assigning works
            with arrays, the difference is just that here the key <em>can</em>

        A summary of important commands that can be used in the context of
        your ruby on rails app. For everyone of these commands but the
        <em>rails new</em> command you have to be in the directory of your app.
        That is the directory with the subfolders described above

              The scaffolding is a special part of Rails. It basically
              magically generates all the common things needed for a new resource
              for you! This includes <em>controllers, models and views</em>. It
              also creates the following basic actions: create a new resource,
              edit a resource, show a resource and delete a resource.
            </p>
            <p>That's what you most basically need. Take this example:</p>
            <p><code><strong>rails generate scaffold</strong> <em>product
              name:string price:integer</em></code></p>
            <p>Now you can create new products, edit them, view them and delete
              them if you don't need them anymore. Nothing stops you from
              creating a full fledged web shop now ;-)</p>

      <h1>Editor tips</h1>
      <p>
        When you write code you will be using a text editor. Of course each text
        editor is different and configurable. Here are just some functions and
        their most general short cuts. All of them work in
        <a href="https://sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a>, you editor may
        differ.
      </p>
      <p>
        The short cuts listed here are for Linux/Windows. On a Mac you will have
        to substitute <em>Ctrl</em> with <em>Cmd</em>.

      <h1>What to do when things go wrong?</h1>
      <p>
        Things go wrong all the time, so don't worry this happens to everyone.
        So keep calm. When you encounter an error message it is always a good
        idea to google the error message and maybe at key words like "rails" or
        "ruby". The most experienced developers do this as well ;-)</p>
      <p>
        There are some mistakes, which I found to be common when an error occurs
        so I made this little checklist for you here:

        <ul>
          <li>Have you run <em>rake db:migrate</em> to apply the newest database
          migrations?</li>
          <li>Have you really saved the file you just changed? Unsaved files are
            often marked in the editor via an asterisk or a point next to their
            name.
          </li>
          <li>If you just added a gem to the Gemfile, have you run <em>bundle
            install</em> to install it?
          </li>
          <li>If you just installed a gem, have you restarted the server?</li>
          <li>
            When you google results from stackoverflow.com are often really 
            helpful. Look for those!
        </ul>
