      <p><strong>Bold</strong> things are what is really important e.g.
        the command or whatever is directly associated with the command.
        <em>Italic</em> things are their arguments. And things in
        brackets are optional :-)
        This will hopefully also be available as a PDF!</p>

      <h3>The Structure of a Rails app</h3>
      An overview of all the folders of brand new Rails application, outlining
      what they are there for. Also touching upon the most important files.

          <td>This folder contains your application. Therefore it is the
            <strong>most important folder</strong> in ruby on rails and it is
            worth digging into its sub folders. See the following rows.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>app/assets</td>
          <td>Assets basically are your front end stuff. This folder contains
            <em>images</em> you use on your website, <em>javascripts</em> for
            all your fancy front end interaction and <em>stylesheets</em> for
            all your css making your website absolutely beautiful.

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>app/controllers</td>
          <td>The controllers subdirectory contains the different controllers of
            an application. A controller handles the requests from
            the users. It is often responsible for a single resource type,
            such as places, users or attendees. Controllers also tie together
            the <em>models</em> and the <em>views</em>.
          </td>

            multiple views.

            logic of our application. It is concerned with the things our
            application is about. Often this is data, that is also saved in the
            database. Examples here are a Person, or a Place class with all
            their typical behaviour.
          </td>

        <tr>
          <td>app/views</td>
          <td>
            <p>The views subdirectory contains the display templates that will
              be displayed to the user after a successful request.
              By default they are written in HTML with embedded ruby
              (.html.erb). The embedded ruby is used to insert data from the
              application. It is then converted to HTML and send to the browser
              of the user. It has subdirectories for every resource of our
              application e.g. places, persons. These subdirectories contain the
              associated view files.</p>

            <p>Files starting with an underscore (<em>_</em>) are so called
              <em>partials</em>. Those are parts of a view which are reused in
              other views. A common example is <em>_form.html.erb</em> which
              contains the basic form for a given resource. It is used in the
              <em>new</em> and in the <em>edit</em> view since creating
              something
              and editing something looks pretty similar.

            application will need, including your database configuration (in
            <em>database.yml</em>) and the particularly important
            <em>routes.rb</em> which decides how web requests are handled.
            More specifically: for a given URL it decides which
            <em>controller</em> will handle the request.

        <tr>
          <td>db</td>
          <td>Contains a lot of <em>database</em> related files.
            Most importantly the <em>migrations</em> subdirectory, containing
            all your database migrations. Those files basically define how your
            database should look like. This is important as it, among other
            things, defines what attributes your models have. With migrations
            you can add new attributes to existing models or create new ones.
            So you could add the <em>favorite_color</em> attribute to your
            Person model so everyone can specify their favorite color.

            those will not show up here. However if they are not available as
            ruby gems then you should put them here. This might be the case for

            It can be used to make sure that everyone within a team is working

      <h2>What to do when things go wrong?</h2>
      <p>
        Things go wrong all the time, so don't worry this happens to everyone.
        So keep calm. When you encounter an error message it is always a good
        idea to google the error message and maybe at key words like "rails" or
        "ruby". </p>
      <p>
        There are some mistakes, which I found to be common when an error occurs
        so I made this little checklist for you here:

        <ul>
          <li>Have you run <em>rake db:migrate</em> to apply the newest database
          migrations?</li>
          <li>Have you really saved the file you just changed? Unsaved files are
            often marked in the editor via an asterisk or a point next to their
            name.
          </li>
          <li>If you just added a gem to the Gemfile, have you run <em>bundle
            install</em> to install it?
          </li>
          <li>If you just installed a gem, have you restarted the server?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
