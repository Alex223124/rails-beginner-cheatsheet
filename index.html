        Hi there! So you are just starting with Rails? That's great!
        And then this place is for you. It summarizes some of the most important
        information about Ruby on Rails. Those things that you tend to forget
        especially in the beginning like: <em>How do I start the server?</em>
        and <em>What was that config directory for again?</em>.
        Furthermore it is directly aimed at beginners so contrary to common
        concise cheat sheets it contains rather verbose descriptions of some
        concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        A word of warning: I just created this and it <strong>
        might contain faults and inaccuracies.</strong> Furthermore it is
        <strong>far from done!</strong> There still is a lot of information
        missing. But I will try to add it and so can you by contributing
        to my <a href="https://github.com/PragTob/rails-beginner-cheatsheet">
        repository</a>. If you <strong>notice any issues</strong> or have ideas
        to improve this cheat sheet please
        <a href="https://github.com/PragTob/rails-beginner-cheatsheet/issues">
        report it at github</a> or <a href="mailto:pragtob@gmail.com">drop me an
        email</a>.
      </p>

      <h1>Cheat Sheet Conventions</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Bold</strong> words are what is really important e.g.
        the command and concept shown in the usage category.
        In the examples and usage columns <em>Italic</em> words mark the
        arguments of a command/method. If they are in brackets, then they
        are optional arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
        However <em>italic words</em> in the descriptions or general text denote
        more general concepts or concepts explained elsewhere in this cheat
        sheet.
      </p>

      <h1>Console Basics</h1>
      <p>
        The console (also called <em>command line, command prompt or
        terminal</em>) is just another way of interacting with your computer.
        So you can basically do anything with it that you could also do with
        your graphical desktop user interface. This sections contains a couple
        of examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the different operating systems <strong>starting the console</strong>
        differs.

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Windows:</strong> Open the start menu and search for
          command prompt. Alternatively choose <em>execute</em> and enter
          <em>cmd</em></li>
          <li><strong>Mac:</strong> Open spotlight type <em>terminal</em> and
          start that program.</li>
          <li><strong>Linux:</strong> The terminal should be one of the main
          options once you open the main menu of your distribution. Otherwise
          search for <em>terminal</em> if your distribution has such an option
          or look under Accessories.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h1>Ruby Basics</h1>
      <p>
        Ruby is the programming language Ruby on Rails is written in. So most
        of the time you will be writing Ruby code. Therefore it is good to
        grasp the basics of Ruby. If you just want to play with ruby type
        <strong>irb</strong> into your console to start interactive ruby. There
        you can easily experiment with Ruby. To leave irb, type
        <strong>exit</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>General concepts</h2>
      <p>variables, calling methods, etc...</p>

      <h2>Numbers</h2>
      <p>TODO</p>

      <h2>Strings</h2>
      <p>TBD</p>

      <h2>Arrays</h2>
      <p>
        An array is an ordered collection of things which is indexed by numbers.
        So an array contains multiple objects that are mostly related to each
        other. So what could you do? You could store a collection of the names
        of your favorite fruits and name it <em>fruits</em>.

          <td>As an Array is a collection of different elements, you often want
            to access a single element of this Array.
            Arrays are indexed by numbers, you can use that number
            to access an individual element. Be aware that the
            numbering actually starts 0 so the first element
            actually is the 0th. And the last element of a 3 element
            array is element number 2.

          <td>Assigning new Array Values works a lot like accessing

         </td>
         <td>
           <p>
             Iterating basically means doing something for <em>each</em> element
             of the array. What is done between <em>do</em> and <em>end</em>
             defines what is done to every element in the array.
           </p>
           <p>
             The first example prints the name of every person in the array to
             the console. The second example simply doubles every number of a
             given array.

              By default they are written in HTML with embedded ruby
              (.html.erb). The embedded ruby is used to insert data from the
              application. It is then converted to HTML and send to the browser
              of the user. It has subdirectories for every resource of our
              application e.g. places, persons. These subdirectories contain the
              associated view files.</p>

            <p>Files starting with an underscore (<em>_</em>) are so called
              <em>partials</em>. Those are parts of a view which are reused in
              other views. A common example is <em>_form.html.erb</em> which
              contains the basic form for a given resource. It is used in the
              <em>new</em> and in the <em>edit</em> view since creating
              something
              and editing something looks pretty similar.

            database should look like. This is important as it, among other
            things, defines what attributes your models have. With migrations
            you can add new attributes to existing models or create new ones.
            So you could add the <em>favorite_color</em> attribute to your

              The scaffolding is a special part of Rails. It basically
              magically generates all the common things needed for a new resource
              for you! This includes <em>controllers, models and views</em>. It
              also creates the following basic actions: create a new resource,
              edit a resource, show a resource and delete a resource.
            </p>
            <p>That's what you most basically need. Take this example:</p>
            <p><strong>rails generate scaffold</strong> <em>product
              name:string price:integer</em></p>
            <p>Now you can create new products, edit them, view them and delete
              them if you don't need them anymore. Nothing stops you from
              creating a full fledged web shop now ;-)</p>

      <h1>Editor tips</h1>
      <p>
        When you write code you will be using a text editor. Of course each text
        editor is different and configurable. Here are just some functions and
        their most general short cuts. All of them work in
        <a href="https://sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a>, you editor may
        differ.
      </p>
      <p>
        The short cuts listed here are for Linux/Windows. On a Mac you will have
        to substitute <em>Ctrl</em> with <em>Cmd</em>.

      <h1>What to do when things go wrong?</h1>
      <p>
        Things go wrong all the time, so don't worry this happens to everyone.
        So keep calm. When you encounter an error message it is always a good
        idea to google the error message and maybe at key words like "rails" or
        "ruby". </p>
      <p>
        There are some mistakes, which I found to be common when an error occurs
        so I made this little checklist for you here:

        <ul>
          <li>Have you run <em>rake db:migrate</em> to apply the newest database
          migrations?</li>
          <li>Have you really saved the file you just changed? Unsaved files are
            often marked in the editor via an asterisk or a point next to their
            name.
          </li>
          <li>If you just added a gem to the Gemfile, have you run <em>bundle
            install</em> to install it?
          </li>
          <li>If you just installed a gem, have you restarted the server?</li>
          <li>
            When you google results from stackoverflow.com are often really 
            helpful. Look for those!
        </ul>
      </p>
